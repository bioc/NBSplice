#'NBSplice: Negative Binomial Models to detect Differential Splicing.
#'
#'The package proposes a differential splicing evaluation method based on 
#'isoform quantification data. It uses generalized linear models with negative 
#'binomial distribution to model changes in isoform relative expression and
#'infer differential changes in gene splicing patterns.
